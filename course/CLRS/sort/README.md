# sorting algo

## based on compartion

- [x] bubble sort
    - [x] cocktail shaker sort
    - [x] odd-even sort
        - [x] parallel odd-even sort
    - [x] comb sort

- [x] insert sort
    - [x] insert sort with recursion
    - [x] insert sort with binary search
    - [x] insert sort with linked list
    - [x] gnome sort (optimizaiton version)

- [x] select sort

- [ ] heap sort

- [ ] shell sort
- [ ] library sort


- [x] merge sort
    - [ ] binary merge sort (merge sort + binary insert sort)
- [ ] quick sort
    - [x] quick sort with binary tree

- [ ] introspect (quick sort & insert sort)

## bad algo (wosre than O(N^2))

- [x] slow sort
- [ ] stooge sort
- [ ] bogo sort
    continue shuffle until sorted

## others

- [x] radix sort
    O(nB), B is bits of number

# perf test

## test case

- reversed order
- random data
- sorted
    - bubble sort & insert sort work well.
- sub-sorted
    - insert sort works well.

## measuring

- compare times
- swap times
