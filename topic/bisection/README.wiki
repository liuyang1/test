Background:

To merge CR efficiency, we want to do BFT(build, flash, test) with a bundle of several CRs.
However, there may be a bad CR that break the BFT by mistake.
On that situation, we need do bi-section search to find the bad CRs.
In more worse case, they are more bad CR in the bundle. We will check the CRs one by one to locate all bad CRs.

Analysis:
Assume the prob of bad CRs is p.
- all good CRs, prob=(1-p)^N, it need one time BFT.
- one bad CRs, prob=N*p*(1-p)^N, it need 2*[log(N)+1] times BFT.
    - first time build (bad)
    - 2\*log(N) time to locate the bad/good CL
    - one more time to BFT with all the good CR
- two bad CRs, prob=1-p0-p1, we guess it need (N+4) times BFT.

Conclusion:

We will find when prob=0.05, the best bundle size is [4,8]
Otherwise, it may cost even more time to find the bad CRs.
