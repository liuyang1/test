== basic ==
* 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a
specific target number.

Requirement: complexity O(n * log(n))

    - quicksort this array with memorize origin index( as we must return origin
    index)
    - cursor moving, one from left, one from right.
        - when sum is less, moving left cursor
        - when sum is greater, moving right cursor

NOTICE: qsort return list with ascending sequence, comparing function return
1 when A GREATER than B.

* 2. Add Two Numbers
linked-list represent numbers, one node contains a single digit. Digits are
stored in reverse order.

    - Adding number with manually adding digit and carry

* 67. Add Binary strings, return sum

    - remove extra leading zero, but keep it if only one zero

== math ==
* 168. Excel Sheet Column Title

    remember minus one first as it's biased.

* 171. Excel Sheet Column Number

This problem look like 26-base number, but must notice A is not zero, but ONE.

* 169. Majority element in array

    Moore's Voting Algorithm! Very cool idea!

* 229. Majority element in array II

Support find all element that appear more than [n / K] times.

    Misra-Geries Algorithm, inspired by Moore's Voting Algorithm.

* 258. Digit Root
Repeatedly add all digits until result has only one digit.

    All number roundly map to [1, 9] , except zero map to zero. Then get
    beautiful function.

=== Probability ===
* 169. Majority element in array

    Just guess any random one, then check it is majority. As Probability, in
    average, only need guess twice, so this complexity is O(n)
    We even can avoid re-guess wrong one, so guess less times.

=== Combination ===
* 62. Unique paths

m * n grid, from left-upper corner move to bottom-right corner, How many
possible unique paths?

    Just `combination(m + n - 2, m - 1)`.
    Mind not overflow when calculate combination

=== Computational Geometry ===
* 223. Find total area covered by two rectangles which may overlap.

    simply start calc on 1-D line, then easily and elegant extend to 2-D

== struct ==
=== array ===
=== linked list ===
=== tree ===
==== Traverse on tree ====
* 100. Same Tree
* 112. Path Sum

    - Traverse on tree

* 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

    - use stack to iteratively on tree

== algorithm ==
=== binary search ===

= Issues =
== runtime error, but local run good ==
runtime checking different, may read or write out of bound, but local don't
warning this, double check it.

== memory leak ==
Online Judge system won't check memory leak, fix them all with `cppcheck`.
