# 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a
specific target number.

Requirement: complexity O(n * log(n))

- quicksort this array with memorize origin index( as we must return origin
index)
- cursor moving, one from left, one from right.
    - when sum is less, moving left cursor
    - when sum is greater, moving right cursor

NOTICE: qsort return list with ascending sequence, comparing function return
1 when A GREATER than B.

# 2. Add Two Numbers
linked-list represent numbers, one node contains a single digit. Digits are
stored in reverse order.

- Adding number with manually adding digit and carry

# 67. add Binary strings, return sum

- remove extra leading zero, but keep it if only one zero
